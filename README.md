# ANN-design-and-formal-verification-Forum
This repository is dedicated to ongoing research aimed at developing an effective methodology for the verification of neural networks implemented in hardware. The primary focus is on leveraging formal verification techniques to ensure the reliability and correctness of deep neural networks integrated into hardware systems.

A Tool for Verifying Neural Networks using SMT-Based Model Checking. Using Frama-C and ESBMC as the backends. You can find detailed descriptions of QNNVerifyer in paper QNNVerifier: A Tool for Verifying Neural Networks using SMT-Based Model Checking https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.13110.pdf

And the Corresponding codebase of the paper is here https://github.com/HymnOfLight/QNNVerifier

Here is the link for both the libraries which converts ANN to C Keras2c > https://github.com/kraiskil/onnx2c [github.com] 
Onnx2c > https://github.com/f0uriest/keras2c [github.com]

Here is the link for tool which is used in step 3 of the the paper Invarient  Analysis using  FRAMA-C with EVA Plugin Tool https://frama-c.com/fc-plugins/eva.html [frama-c.com]

Here is the link to build the  quantised neural networks on top of the DSVerifier libraries. Link:
