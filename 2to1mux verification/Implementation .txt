//Implementation 

1) Activation Function:

We used a simple threshold function as the activation function. The threshold function determines the output based on whether the weighted sum of inputs and a bias is above a certain threshold.

2) Neural Network Parameters:

The neural network had two inputs (input1 and input2) and a selector (selector). Weights (w1, w2, wsel) and a bias (bias) were introduced to control the behavior of the neural network.

3) Weighted Sum Calculation:

The weighted sum was calculated as sum = (input1 * w1) + (input2 * w2) + (selector * wsel) + bias.

4) Activation Function Application:

The result of the weighted sum was passed through the threshold function using neural_network function, which returned either 0 or 1 based on the activation threshold.

5) Verification:

The correctness of the implementation was verified using the CBMC solver and assertions. The expected behavior of the neural network for different input combinations was asserted to ensure proper functioning.
